# Email-Spam-Filter
This C program's purpose is to determine whether an email is spam or not by examining its contents and cross-referencing it with predefinedÂ whitelist and blacklist entries. This program effectively determines whether an email is spam by using hash maps and a bloom filter. The user can use text files with their own whitelist and blacklist.
